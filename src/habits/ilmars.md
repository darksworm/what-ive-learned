How to break a bad habit
------------------------

I want to stop doing **X**

1.  Make it as hard as possible to do **X**
    -   If its based on consumables (e.g. junkfood) - don’t keep it at
        your home if possible
    -   If its based on inconsumables (e.g. smartphone) - keep it as far
        as away as possible
2.  Every time you catch yourself returning to the habit, stop yourself
3.  Get busy / Distract yourself

How to form a habit
-------------------

I want to do **X** regularly

#### Simplify it / break it down

-   focus on specifics
-   make one change at a time

#### Make it as easy as possible to follow

-   e.g. Keep fresh fruit instead of junkfood at home
-   make associated items as available and visible as possible
-   start very small - *“How much of **X** is stupidly easy to do?”*

#### Build habits on habits

Each of us already have some built-in habits upon which we can build.

-   create morning, evening routines
-   you can add small habits to:
    -   every time you eat
    -   every time you go to the bathroom
    -   every break you take at work
    -   anything you do regularly…

#### Don’t

-   Don’t try to form multiple habits at once
-   Don’t attempt making large changes in a short amount of time
-   Don’t do so much of **X** that you start disliking it

### You should be saying:

*“It’s already here… So i might as well…”*

*“That’s ridiculously easy, i can surely do that!”*

### If you find yourself saying:

*“I already did **Y** amount of **X** yesterday… I’ll skip today”* - you
should lower the frequency/amount of **X**
